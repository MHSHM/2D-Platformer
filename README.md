# 2D-Platformer (No engine used)
To build the game without the help of unity or unreal or any other known game engine i had to build first an engine or at least the core part of an engine then put the game logic on top of it.
For the window and the input i used glfw3 and for the rendering i used opengl 3.x with glew. 

# Features that the game has
- Entity-Component system architecture.
- 2D physics.
- Collision detection.
- Sprite Animation.
- Scene Graph
- Support for multiple Scenes.

The engine dosen't have packaging system so currently the only way to play the game is to download the whole thing and build it.
You can do that by simply downloading the project then building it using visual studio (if you're using windows of course). 
Also it dosen't have editor so all the scenes were created with code which sucks i know 
but all i wanted was to create a simple 2d game with the core mechanics up and running so i didn't bother implementing it.
The game is not finished yet and it currently has only one level. For anyone that want to give a try and write some code or add a feature to the game
Game::Load_Data() runs only once when the engine starts
Game::Update() runs every frame
